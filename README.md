Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Answer:
Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools into developing high quality software products. 
Software engineering is important in the technology industry in the sense that it enables the creation of sofware applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life,
such as communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


The three key milestones of software engineering include;
Answer:
1, The development of programming languages such as Fortran, and C.
2,The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
3, The advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


Phases of Software development life cycle:
Answer:
1, Requirements: This involved researching and gathering user needs and system needs.
2, Design: Creating and disigning the architecture of the sofware to be developed.
3, Implementation: Writing the actual code and developing the sofware product according to the requirement specification and design.
4, Testing: This is done to ensure the software meets its standards and quality.
5, Deployment: Sharing and making the software product available to the end users.
6, Maintenance: Providing new features and ensuring that the software is always available and reliable to the end users. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer:
The Waterfall model is a sequential approach with distinct phases such as the requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance flowing downwards like a waterfall
while the agile model is an iterative and incremental approach that is focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer:
1, Software Developer writes the codes and implement the software solutions after design has been made.
2, A Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for testing the quality of the codes written by the software developer.
3, A Project Manager oversees the all development of a software product.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer:
IDEs is very important the software development process because it is the environment were software products are written and developed. An example of it is the visual studio code editor.
VCS helps in collaborating with other software developers and help in tracking changes made to our codebase. An example is Git and Github.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer:
1, Changing Requirements
2, Tight Deadlines
3, Technical Depth
All three challenges can be overcome through effective communication, the use of agile methodologies, priotization of tasks, and regular assessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Answer:
1, Unit testing: For individual modules, functions and components of a sofware solutions.
2, Integrated testing: A method used for testing how the different components of a software applications works together.
3, Acceptance testing: This is achived through deployment and testing with the end users.
All three steps above are important in software quality assurance because it will actually help to detect bugs and fix softare issues in early stages of softawre development.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Answer:
Prompt engineering is about cratfting instructions and questions in a way to get the best responses or answers.
It is very important in interacting with AI models because when used properly it help to get a concise, direct and better response from the AI.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Answer:
An AI is what?
the better approach will be, What is AI?
What is AI is a more effective prompt because its specifically tells the bot what you want to know about as compared to An AI is what?.
