Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

Software engineering systematically applies to engineering principles, methods, and tools into developing high quality software products. 
Software engineering is important in the technology industry in the sense that it enables the creation of sofware applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, such as communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

The three key milestones of software engineering includes; The development of programming languages such as Fortran, and C, the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

Phases of Software development life cycle includes; Requirements, this involved researching and gathering user needs and system needs. Design, this involves creating and disigning the architecture of the sofware to be developed. Implementation, it involves writing the actual code and developing the sofware product according to the requirement specification and design. Testing, this is done to ensure the software meets its standards and quality. Deployment, this is about sharing and making the software product available to the end users. Maintenance, this involves providing new features and ensuring that the software is always available and reliable to the end users. 

The Waterfall model is a sequential approach with distinct phases such as the requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance flowing downwards like a waterfall while the agile model is an iterative and incremental approach that is focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

1, Software Developer writes the codes and implement the software solutions after design has been made.
2, A Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for testing the quality of the codes written by the software developer.
3, A Project Manager oversees the all development of a software product.

Integrated Development Environment(IDEs) is very important in the software development process because it is the environment were software products are written and developed.An example of it is the visual studio code editor.
Version Control System(VCS) helps in collaborating with other software developers and help in tracking changes made to our codebase. An example is Git and Github.

Common challenges faced by software engineers and strategies to overcome the challenges are:
1, Changing Requirements
2, Tight Deadlines
3, Technical Depth
All three challenges can be overcome through effective communication, the use of agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular assessment of project goals and timelines.

Different types of testing and their importance in software quality assurance:
1, Unit testing: For individual modules, functions and components of a sofware solutions.
2, Integrated testing: A method used for testing how the different components of a software applications works together.
3, Acceptance testing: This is achived through deployment and testing with the end users.
All three test above are important in software quality assurance because it will actually help to detect bugs and fix softare issues in early stages of softawre development.

Prompt engineering and its importance in interacting with AI models:

Prompt engineering is about cratfting instructions and questions in a way to get the best responses or answers.
It is very important in interacting with AI models because when used properly it help to get a concise, direct and better response from the AI.

An example of a vague prompt and its improvements:
An AI is what?
the better approach will be, What is AI?
What is AI is a more effective prompt because its specifically tells the bot what you want to know about as compared to An AI is what?.
